# Lightweight DL Model for Detection of Copy-move Image Forgery with Post-processed Attacks

This repo implements the state-of-the-art SSmallerVGGNet (inspired from VGGNet) and MobileNetV2. These two models are time and resource friendly deep learning frameworks for digital image forgery detection 
on embedded devices.  The experimentation considers a suitably modified version of MobileNetV2 to be more effective on copy-move forgery detection which also caters for inconsistencies executed post-forgery
including visual-appearance related such as brightness change, blurring and noise adding and geometric transformations such as cropping and rotation.
